# MyVirtualMuseumApp
MyVirtualMuseumApp helps a visitor photograph and document a museum exhibit so that others can participate virtually. 
This project's purpose is to farmiliarize me with Flutter, its state patterns, and its various widgets and functionality.

Artworks displayed in a gallery exhibit always have an informational plauque. It displays artist name, title of the piece, date created, and medium. I call it 'Information' in the code.

Artworks are conventially documented as pictured, with: 1.) A photo of the entire work; 2.) A close up of an area of interest (known as a Detail photo); 3.) A summary of information about the work (title of the piece, artist name, medium, and date of creation); and 4.) A written description of the work prepared by the curator. These items are referred to in the code as Photo, Detail, Information, and Description. (See figure 1)

A database is not the most appropriate implementation to store art pieces within this app. A List that that changes size dynamically would provide flexibility for a user to take as many photos of an art piece as they wanted. However, since I want to familiarize myself with Flutter's database implementation methods, I might implement the following DB. The DB holds 4 photos to correspond with the art piece data pictured in figure 1.

To do
------------------------
- [  ] Where can I apply Block pattern to control state? (Maybe need some other state patterns for other things, like the button). 
- [  ] Draw a picture of all the different local and global states so I can see how state patterns might operate in unison.
- [  ] Make a new branch on Git so that I can revert back when I break this thing again.
- [  ] Investigate yaml file to learn why 2nd image has never displayed.
- [  ] Look at maps and tile widgets. Can I hold all the exhibit images in a map at the top level? This might make state simpler.
- [  ] Start looking at how to access camera function.

It could also hold the Body of Soviet Art Exhibit that I really liked.
Or, the Exhibit on Owls because Elena really likes owls and they just had that speaker who was a grad student at the U of MN who did research on Fishing Owls.
These would be good test cases. 
But, Letâ€™s look at the current exhibit.

In Flutter, it makes sense to keep the state above the widgets that use it. Source: Stateful Widgets: https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/simple
