# MyVirtualMuseumApp
MyVirtualMuseumApp holds a list of museum exhibits that I visited so that other people can participate in a virtual visit and make a donation during the times of corona virus.

My VirtualMusesumApp holds a Stateful Widget called an Exhibit.
It could also hold the Body of Soviet Art Exhibit that I really liked.
Or, the Exhibit on Owls because Elena really likes owls and they just had that speaker who was a grad student at the U of MN who did research on Fishing Owls.
These would be good test cases. 
But, Letâ€™s look at the current exhibit.

In Flutter, it makes sense to keep the state above the widgets that use it. Source: Stateful Widgets: https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/simple
